#  Ultralytics YOLOv8 Object Detection Model - Detection, Segmentation and Classification on Custom Dataset)

YOLOv8 is the newest state-of-the-art YOLO model that can be used for object detection, image classification, and instance segmentation tasks. YOLOv8 was developed by Ultralytics, who also created the influential and industry-defining YOLOv5 model. YOLOv8 includes numerous architectural and developer experience changes and improvements over YOLOv5. In this session, you will learn object detection, segmentation and classification using a custom dataset.
